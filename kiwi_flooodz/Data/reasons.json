    "reason1": "I'm sorry and I promise I wont do it again. After being banned for a while now I wanted to appologies and appeal this punishment because I feel I should deserve a second chance. Thanks",
    "reason2": "I really want to say that I am writing this not for sympathy, but for another chance for a ban appeal. I wasimage.png unable to create another ban appeal for my punishment a while ago. I want another chance to show that I have changed. I want to prove to everyone that I am a better person. But ultimately, there's been a lingering feeling of regret and guilt that I've had since, and I just want to apologize to everyone for cheating a while ago. I was very toxic and angry, and it was a way to get out of reality. I was anxious and stressed about a lot of stuff. I was still growing up, and I still am. Again, I am really sorry, and I genuinely feel remorseful. I feel like I owe all of you guys and the kiwi staff an apology, and I beg for another chance at a ban appeal.",

    "reason5": "I was recently banned for using hacks, and I admit I was using the mod. I wish to apologize for it and ask for a second chance since it was my first offense. In the rest of my letter I will go into detail my motives of using hacks, how long I have used hacks, how much money I made using hacks, apologize for using it, and ask for forgiveness. I ask you to read the rest of the letter because I became emotionally attached to the server.",
    "reason6": "Please forgive my offense. I will never use this mod on your server again, never. Not to any extent. If I do use this mod again I will accept any punishment that is served for two reasons. I would be lying to you if I continued using this mod after you gave me a second chance and I wouldnâ€™t deserve a third chance if I did this again.",
    "reason7": "Well, i've been thinking of what I've done, and I didn't really regret it, because I thought minecraft was ruining my life in many different ways. After around a month, I logged in with a few of my alts and just messed up my whole reputation by doing stupid stuff, because I was just so angry with myself, and about what I've done, and how many of my friends on kiwi  i've pissed off. I've been thinking to myself, should I make a ban appeal? And around 2 days later (Now), i've decided to go with appealing. Yes, this was definitely a perm-ban, and I do admit what I've done at that time. I've lost all my money, and I was very frustrated. I couldn't control myself what to do, after a lot of work I've put in, and the trouble I went through. You should consider this appeal, and I am sorry to all my town residents.",
    "reason8": "I would like to formally apologise for my actions towards the staff team, the way i acted was totally unecesary and ridiculous; i recognise this. I hope that i haven't offended you to greatly, and that we can start again as friends. I am now asking you, the Minecraft Friendly players Server community, to lift the ban request on my minecraft account. thank you for reading this, have a nice day.",
